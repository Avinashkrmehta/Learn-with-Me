Time Complexity and Space Complexity

-> There are two such methods used, time complexity and space complexity which are discussed below:

Time Complexity:- The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.



The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.

Time Complexity:- The rate at which the time, required to run a code, changes with respect to the input size, is considered the time complexity. Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.


calculating the time complexity:

We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
We will avoid including the constant terms.
We will also avoid the lower values.



Space Complexity:- Space complexity generally represents the summation of auxiliary space and the input space. Auxiliary space refers to the space that we use additionally to solve a problem. And input space refers to the space that we use to store the inputs.
